# Linkte

This is a personal project written with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS. This is a culmination of various tidbits I have found useful. It may even contain certain tools I have found useful.

#### Want to make your own ?

```plaintext
I assume you know your way around a yarn project.
$ npx --yes degit DevParapalli/linkte
$ cd linkte

Read through the .svelte files, the .json files and try modifying them.
The app is configured to deploy on Netlify. Modify the adapter in the svelte.config.js file.

Happy Hacking!
